# style

This is the stylesheet structure & boilerplate that I seem to be repeating on every project lately. It scales.

- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
- [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)
- Mobile first responsive grid with [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- Seperately rendered stylesheet for Old IE
